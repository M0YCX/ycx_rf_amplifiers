# Linvill Stability Factor from Y-Parameters

> Ref: RF Circuit Design 2nd Edition by Chris Bowick

$$
C = \frac{|y_r y_f|}{2 g_i g_o - Re(y_r y_f)}
$$

where:
* $|\ \ |$ is the magnitude if the complex product in brackets
* $y_r$ is the reverse-transfer admittance
* $y_f$ is the forward-transfer admittance
* $g_i$ is the input conductance
* $g_o$ is the output conductance
* $Re()$ is the real part of the complex product in parenthesis
